# Summary

Tuned Lens is a package for transformer mechanistic interpretability developed by EleutherAI contributors.

https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/tuned-lens
https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08112

It extends the Logit Lens visualisation by applying transformations to internal layers so that the logits derived from each layer can be interpreted as predictions of the next token. It depends on model-specific tuned-lenses, pretrained lenses are available from https://huggingface.co/spaces/AlignmentResearch/tuned-lens/tree/main/lens
